# Code indexing features

1. **Component Extraction Module**

    - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Parse code and extract structural elements.
    - Gather rich metadata including decorators, base classes, docstrings, file paths, and line numbers.
    - **Sub-Features:**  
    - **AST-Based Parsing:** Use your existing code parser to traverse the AST.
    - **Extraction of Key Elements:** Capture functions, classes, methods, and their relevant details (decorators, signatures, base classes).
    - **Metadata Structuring:** Organize extracted data into a consistent format for downstream processing.
    - **Why**: This is the foundation. Itâ€™s essential to reliably parse and extract rich, structured code components (including decorators and base classes) before any semantic processing.
    - **Focus**: Enhance your existing parser to capture all key attributes.

2. Embedding Generation Module:

    - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Convert extracted code components into vector representations.
    - Combine code structure with natural language elements (docstrings, comments).
    - **Sub-Features:**  
    - **Model Integration:** Utilize code-specific embedding models (e.g., CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT).
    - **Dynamic & Composite Embeddings:** Generate embeddings that combine multiple aspects of a component.
    - **Re-indexing and Incremental Updates:** Update embeddings as the codebase evolves.
    **Why**: High-quality embeddings are critical for semantic search accuracy. Converting your extracted components (with their enhanced details) into vectors is the next key step.
    **Focus**: Integrate a code-specific embedding model and ensure it supports composite embeddings (structure + natural language).

3. Vector Storage & Retrieval Module:

    - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Store the generated embedding vectors and associated metadata.
    - Perform efficient similarity searches and filtering based on metadata.
    - **Sub-Features:**  
    - **Vector Database Integration:** Use systems like FAISS, Milvus, or Pinecone.
    - **Hybrid Search Capabilities:** Combine semantic vector similarity with metadata filtering.
    - **Search Metrics Configuration:** Implement similarity metrics (cosine, Euclidean) and use approximate nearest neighbor algorithms.
    **Why**: With embeddings in hand, you need an efficient vector database to store and retrieve them via similarity search. This module directly impacts the responsiveness and scalability of your search functionality.
    **Focus**: Set up and configure a vector store (like FAISS, Milvus, or Pinecone) and implement effective similarity metrics.

4. Query Processing Module:

    - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Accept and process user queries in various formats (pseudocode, natural language).
    - Decompose complex queries into manageable sub-queries.
    - **Sub-Features:**  
    - **Semantic Query Embedding:** Convert user queries into embedding vectors.
    - **Query Decomposition & Expansion:** Break down pseudocode into individual steps and expand queries with synonyms/paraphrasing.
    - **Result Ranking & Aggregation:** Rank and aggregate search results based on relevance and metadata.
    **Why**: This module bridges the gap between user intent and your vector store. Converting pseudocode or natural language queries into embedding vectors and decomposing complex queries will directly affect usability.
    **Focus**: Develop mechanisms for query embedding, decomposition, and result ranking.

5. User Interaction & Feedback Module:

    - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Interface with developers and provide tools to refine search results.
    - Incorporate user feedback into iterative system improvements.
    - **Sub-Features:**  
    - **Interactive Search Interface:** REST APIs or IDE integrations for real-time queries.
    - **Feedback Collection:** Mechanisms for rating relevance and providing corrective feedback.
    - **Active Learning:** Utilize feedback to refine ranking algorithms and improve embedding quality.
    **Why**: While not critical for initial functionality, this module adds value by allowing iterative improvements based on user feedback and making the search experience more interactive.
    **Focus**: Build APIs or interfaces for real-time query submission and feedback collection.

6. Scalability, Monitoring, and Integration Module:

    - **Responsibilities:**  
    - Ensure the system scales with large codebases and dynamic changes.
    - Monitor system performance and integrate with development pipelines.
    - **Sub-Features:**  
    - **Incremental Indexing & Distributed Architecture:** Support real-time updates and horizontal scaling.
    - **Performance Analytics & Monitoring:** Track query latency, indexing times, and user engagement.
    - **Security & Integration:** Secure storage for embeddings and provide APIs/SDKs for seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines and IDEs.
    **Why**: Important for long-term maintenance and performance, this module is best addressed once the core functionality is proven.
    **Focus**: Implement incremental indexing, performance monitoring, and seamless integrations with development tools as you scale.
